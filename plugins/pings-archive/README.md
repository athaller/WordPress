```
[pings]
```

By default, the shortcode shows all pings ever targeted to any post. You can limit the search results with some parameters:

  - **targets** (comma-separated list), to specify posts to which you want to show the pings
  - **n**, to specify the amount of pings shown
  - **d**, to specify how old pings you want to show (in days)

For example, the following markup will show 5 latest pings in the last 30 days for the post ID's 26 and 32:

```
[pings targets="26,32" n="5" d="30"]
```

That's it!
